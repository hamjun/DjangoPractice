Setup:
1. pip install django                                           (install django)
2. django-admin startproject mysite                             (create directory)
3. cd mysite                                                    (go into the directory)
4. python manage.py startapp main                               (create my own app)
5. python manage.py runserver                                   (test the server to see if it works)
6. views.py                                                     (manage the HTTP requests/responses)
7. urls.py                                                      (directory from main(mysite) to acutal main(main) using paths)
8. add main to settings.py                                      (let django recoginze that I have my custom app that needs to be built)
9. python manage.py migrate                                     (apply changes that I made to the settings.py)

Databases:
10. models.py                                                   (Make models in SQLite)
11. class for models (models.Model)                             (ToDoList and Item linked with a foreign key)
12. python manage.py makemigrations main                        (Tell django that I made new models) 
13. python manage.py migrate                                    (apply the change after i make it, revert function allowed)
14. python manage.py shell                                      (opens up a shell so that you can do thing to database)
15. from main.models import Item, ToDoList                      (make a item in the database)
    t = ToDoList(name="Jun\'s List")
    t.save()
16. ToDoList.objects.all()                                      (access elements in the database)
    ToDoList.objects.get(id=1)
    ToDoList.objects.get(name="Jun's List") 
17. t.item_set.create(text="go to the mall", complete=False)    (add item that is relationally bound)
    t.item_set.all()                                            (see all elements)
    t.item_set.get(id=1)
18. path("<int:id>", views.index, name="index")                 (add this to url path so we can get id from element)
19. ls = ToDoList.objects.get(id = id)                          (access the element by id through the url)
20. t.filter(name__startswith="Jun")                            (query elements in the database)
    t.filter(id=1)
21. del_object = t.get(id=1)                                    (how to delete elements from the database)
    del_object.delete()

Admin Daseboard:
22. python manage.py createsuperuser                            (create credentials for user and password)
23. admin.py admin.site.register(x)                             (make it so that we can see the models in our admin site)

Templates:
24. Create a template and main folder                           (main subdir needs to be the same name as the app for django to recognize)
25. Base.html and home.html                                     (Base template that all other templates will extend from)
26. Update views.py and urls.py                                 (Allow navigation to the html template that we wrote)
27. render(response, "main/base.html", {"name":ls.name})        (get the variables that were called in the html tempaltes in this case "name")
28. {% block content %} {% endblock %}                          (the block "content" can be overwritten in other templates)
    {% block content%}
    <h1>Home Page</h1>
    {% endblock %}
29. {% for item in ls.item_set.all %}                           (dont put the parentehsis at the end as it will cause error)
30. MAKE SURE INDENT IS OFF
